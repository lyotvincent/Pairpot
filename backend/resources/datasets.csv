Stem cells, progenitors, and newborn neurons tightly interact with their neighbouring cells and tissue microenvironment, and this intricate interplay ultimately shapes the output of neurogenesis. Given the relevance of spatial cues during brain development, we acknowledge the necessity for a transcriptomics atlas within the tissue context accessible to the neurodevelopmental community. To fulfil this need, we offer an open-access spatial gene expression browser of the embryonic mouse brain at the peak of neurogenesis. Using 10x Visium technology, we generated spatially-resolved RNAseq data from E13.5 embryonic brain sections. Unsupervised clustering reliably defined specific cell type populations of diverse lineages and maturational states. Differential expression analysis revealed unique transcriptional signatures across specific embryonic brain areas, uncovering novel features inherent to particular anatomical domains. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNAseq data from E13.5 mouse brains into our Spatial Transcriptomics data, adding tissue context to single-cell resolution. In summary, we provide a valuable tool that enables the exploration and discovery of unforeseen molecular players involved in neurogenesis, particularly in the crosstalk between different cell types.","Four sections from four different WT mouse embryonic heads (stage E13.5) were extracted for spatial transcriptomics using the 10x Genomics Visium platform in order to identify areas of the embryonic brain with different cell lineages and maturation states at the peak of neurogenesis.","2023-08-11 00:00:00","2023-10-13 00:00:00","Di Marco B;Vázquez-Marín J;Monyer H;Centanin L;Alfonso J","jvazmar89@gmail.com;javier.vazquez@cos.uni-heidelberg.de","Di Marco, Barbara et al. “Spatial transcriptomics map of the embryonic mouse brain - a tool to explore neurogenesis.” Biology open vol. 12,10 (2023): bio060151. doi:10.1242/bio.060151","https://db.cngb.org/stomics/project/STT0000051","GPL24247","37855382","5"

These problems affect the applicability and efficiency of the process. To address these issues, a high-performance and accurate spatial transcriptomics data analysis workflow called Stereo-Seq Analysis Workflow (SAW) has been developed for the Stereo-Seq technology developed by BGI. This workflow includes mRNA spatial position reconstruction, genome alignment, gene expression matrix generation and clustering, and generate results files in a universal format for subsequent personalized analysis.

Besides, depending on the cell type and tissue, nuclei size may vary significantly to an extent that it may exceed the thickness of tissue slices. This may jeopardize capturing full transcriptomics profile of single slice due to the improper/incomplete incision of nuclei during cryosectioning process and this may cause drawbacks in downstream analysis.   To monitor the probable consequences, we monitored the effect of consecutive slices data integration (CSDI) on improvement of cell type clustering and annotation through transferring cell labels from a single-nuclei transcriptomics dataset to ST. To do so, two consecutive slices from the orbitofrontal neocortex and temporal neocortex of two post mortem brain samples were obtained and their spatial transcriptomics profiles were retrieved using 10x Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression protocol.     Using CSDI, not only the number of identified clusters were increased and the inconsistency between the pattern of clusters in consecutive slices was resolved, but the layered-structure of gray matter was unveiled. Besides, only after CSDI the transferred annotations from single-nuclei transcriptomics to ST could match the microscopic results.  CSDI can improve the ST clustering and cell type annotation by providing the full signals coming from all cell types of single slice of tissue.

We substantiate the exhausted phenotype of CD8 T cells and immunosuppressive features of myeloid cells, and highlight immune subpopulations with potentially underappreciated roles in PDAC, particularly CD4 T cell subsets presenting immunosuppressive phenotypes with varying modes of exhaustion. We also demonstrate the dynamic changes associated with transcriptional reprogramming of immune subtypes within adjacent normal tissue and tumor surrounding stroma, and further reveal striking differences between immune phenotypes in PDAC and lung adenocarcinoma, which at least partially explain their differential responsiveness to current immunotherapies and might have implications for the development of novel treatment strategies.","Eight tissue sections were subjected to spatial transcriptomic analysis by using the Visium technology(30) (10x Genomics) according to the protocol of the manufacturer.

A pivotal function of megakaryocytes is the generation of platelets through the release of long protrusions called proplatelets into sinusoidal vessels. single-cell RNA-sequencing on murine BM megakaryocytes has previously revealed transcriptional heterogeneity with segmentation into four distinct categories. These studies postulated functions beyond platelet production with evidence for immunoregulatory and stem cell niche supporting subtypes, as well as a cycling population. The spatial context and transcriptional heterogeneity of megakaryocytes is of great interest as localization of for instance the vasculature is a necessity for platelet production. For single-cell RNA sequencing this spatial orientation is however lost due to the dissociation of tissues. Recent technological advances have enabled the interrogation of gene expression profiles of tissues in situ.

Clinical and experimental studies show that moxibustion can improve the learning and memory abilities of AD. In order to explore whether moxibustion can affect the polarization of AQP4 around blood brain barrier (BBB), we used spatial transcriptomics (ST) to analyze the expression and polarization of Aqp4 in wild type mice, APP/PS1 mice and APP/PS1 mice intervened by moxibustion. The results showed that moxibustion improved the loss of abnormal polarization of AQP4 in APP/PS1 mice, especially in the hypothalamic BBB. Besides, there are other 31 genes with Aqp4 as the core have the similar depolarization in APP/PS1 mice, most of which are also membrane proteins. The majority of them have been reversed by moxibustion. At the same time, we employed the cerebrospinal fluid circulation gene set, which was found being on a higher level in the group of APP/PS1 mice with moxibustion treatment. Finally, in order to further explore its mechanism, we analyzed the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex enzymes closely related to energy metabolism, and found that moxibustion can significantly increase the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes such as Cox6a2 in the hypothalamus, which could provide energy for mRNA transport. Our research shows that increasing the polarization of hypothalamic Aqp4 through mitochondrial energy supply may be an important target for moxibustion to improve APP/PS1 mice’s cognitive impairment.","The WT mice were male C57BL/6J mice, while AD model mice were male APP/PS1 double transgenic mice.

We not only identified three ‘HPV-related epithelial clusters’ unique to normal, HSIL and cervical cancer respectively, but also discovered node genes which potentially determined the disease progression. Moreover, we observed a gradual transition of multiple immune cells from positive immune response to dysregulation and exhaustion, to an immune-suppressive microenvironment during the malignant program.

Recently, a CLEAR III trial (NCT00784134) employing alteplase effectively cleared intraventricular haematoma but did not demonstrate adequate neuro behavioural benefits for patients. Therefore, the present study sought to investigate the pathophysiology of how these haematoma stimulations in ventricles cause neurological dysfunction. An autologous blood stereotactic injection model was employed to establish and mimic secondary IVH in mice, followed by our innovated spatial transcriptome sequencing-based bioinformatic algorithm to investigate the 3D spatial brain regions affected by the primary stimulation of haematoma in the ipsilateral ventricle after IVH, as well as related cell-cell communication strength and pathway analysis. These data illustrate that the three main 3D global pseudospace-time trajectory bundles represent the main neural circuits from the lateral ventricle to the hippocampus and primary cortex induced by experimental intraventricular haematoma stimulation. Further analysis indicated a rapid response in the primary cortex, as well as a direct and integrated effect on the hippocampus after IVH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to interrogate secondary brain injury after IVH by using spatial transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. These data could provide more helpful information on the pathophysiological mechanism of IVH in patients after acute brain injury, as well as for the bioinformatics analysis strategies for similar studies in the future.","We collected wild-type C57/BL6 mouse brains, which were classified into the no-surgery group (control), the needle-puncture group without blood injection (sham), and the needle-puncture group with blood injection at 1st, 3rd and 7th day.

After dissection, tissues were embedded in OCT compound and frozen fresh in liquid nitrogen. 10um thick tissue sections were mounted onto the Visium Spatial Gene Expression v1 slides. For heart samples, one tissue section was placed into each 6x6mm capture area. For skeletal muscle samples, two tibialis anterior sections were placed into each capture area. After sectioning, tissue sections were fixed in methanol for 20 minutes at -20oC. Next, H&E staining was performed according to the Visium protocol, and tissue sections were imaged. After imaging, the slide was placed into the Visium Slide Cassette. In situ polyadenylation was then performed using yeast Poly(A) Polymerase (Thermo Scientific, cat #74225Z25KU). First, samples were equilibrated by adding 100ul of 1X wash buffer (20ul 5X yPAP Reaction Buffer, 2ul 40U/ul Protector RNase Inhibitor, 78ul nuclease-free H2O) to each capture area and incubating at room temperature for 30 seconds.

The reaction chambers were then sealed and the slide cassette was incubated at 37oC for 25 minutes. The enzyme mix was then removed.

Here we utilize the 10x Visium platform to define the spatial transcriptomic profile in both AD and control (CT) MTG. We identify unique marker genes for cortical layers and the white matter, and layer-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in human AD compared to CT. Deconvolution of the Visium spots showcases the significant difference in particular cell types among cortical layers and the white matter. Gene co-expression analyses reveal eight gene modules, four of which have significantly altered co-expression patterns in the presence of AD pathology. The co-expression patterns of hub genes and enriched pathways in the presence of AD pathology indicate an important role of cell-cell-communications among microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons, which may contribute to the cellular and regional vulnerability in early AD. Using single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization, we validated the cell-type-specific expression of three novel DEGs (e.g., KIF5A, PAQR6, and SLC1A3) and eleven previously reported DEGs associated with AD pathology (i.e., amyloid beta plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles or neuropil threads) at the single cell level.

Here, we perform a pan-cancer single-cell RNA-Seq analysis across 15 cancer types and identify a catalog of gene modules whose expression defines recurrent cancer cell states including ‘stress’, ‘interferon response’, ‘epithelial-mesenchymal transition’, ‘metal response’, ‘basal’ and ‘ciliated’. Spatial transcriptomic analysis linked the interferon response in cancer cells to T cells and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Using mouse models, we further found that induction of the interferon response module varies by tumor location and is diminished upon elimination of lymphocytes. Our work provides a framework for studying how cancer cell states interact with the tumor microenvironment to form organized systems capable of immune evasion, drug resistance, and metastasis.","Cancer cell states recur across tumor types and form specific interactions with the tumor microenvironment","2022-05-23 00:00:00","2022-12-11 00:00:00","Barkley, Dalia;Yanai, Itai","","Barkley, Dalia et al. “Cancer cell states recur across tumor types and form specific interactions with the tumor microenvironment.” Nature genetics vol. 54,8 (2022): 1192-1201. doi:10.1038/s41588-022-01141-9","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE203612","Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens);Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus);Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens; Mus musculus)","35931863","5"

However, it is not clear how DSB-bearing neurons influence neuroinflammation associated with neurodegeneration. Here, we characterize DSB-bearing neurons from the CK-p25 mouse model of neurodegeneration using single-nucleus, bulk, and spatial transcriptomic techniques. DSB-bearing neurons enter a late-stage DNA damage response marked by NFκB-activated senescent and antiviral immune pathways. In humans, Alzheimer’s disease pathology is significantly associated with immune activation in excitatory neurons. Spatial transcriptomics reveal that regions of CK-p25 brain tissue dense with DSB-bearing neurons harbor signatures of inflammatory microglia, which is ameliorated by NFκB knock-down in neurons. Inhibition of NFκB in DSB-bearing neurons also reduces microglia activation in organotypic mouse brain slice culture. In conclusion, DSBs activate immune pathways in neurons, which in turn adopt a senescence-associated secretory phenotype to elicit microglia activation. These findings highlight a novel role for neurons in the mechanism of disease-associated neuroinflammation.","We used the CK-p25 mouse model of neurodegeneration to study the role of DSB-bearing neurons in neurodegeneration.

It is critical to understand the immunologic mechanisms of irAEs with the goal of finding novel treatment targets. Therefore, we studied tissues from irAE dermatitis cases using multiparameter immunofluorescence (IF), spatial transcriptomics,
and RNA in situ hybridization. Skin psoriasis cases were studied as a comparison, as a known Th17-driven disease, and colitis was investigated as a comparison. IF analysis revealed that CD4+ and CD8+ tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells
were preferentially expanded in the inflamed portion of skin in cutaneous irAEs compared to healthy skin controls. Spatial transcriptomics allowed focusing attention on areas containing TRM cells to discern their functional phenotype,
and revealed expression of Th1-associated genes in irAE, compared to Th17-asociated genes in psoriasis. Expression of a range of inhibitory checkpoint molecules was observed, including PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and TIGIT.
RNA in situ hybridization (RISH) technology combined with IF confirmed expression of IFN-γ, CXCL9, CXCL10, and TNF-α in additional irAE dermatitis cases and allowed us to identify production of IFN-γ within TRM cells specifically.

Novel single cell transcriptomics has limited capacity to address this problem because muscle fibers are too long to be engulfed in single cell droplets and single nuclei transcriptomics are complicated by muscle fibers’ multinucleation.

Equally, it is not known whether melanoma growth and metastatic dissemination are supported by overlapping or distinct melanoma subpopulations. By combining mouse genetics, unbiased lineage tracing and quantitative modelling, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we provide evidence of a hierarchical model of tumour growth that mirrors the cellular and molecular logic underlying embryonic neural crest cell fate specification and differentiation. Our findings indicate that tumorigenic competence is associated with a spatially localized perivascular niche environment, a phenotype acquired through a NOTCH3-dependent intercellular communication pathway established by endothelial cells. Consistent with a model in which only a fraction of melanoma cells is fated to fuel growth, temporal single-cell tracing of a population of melanoma cells harbouring a mesenchymal-like state revealed that these cells do not contribute to primary tumour growth but, instead, constitutes a pool of metastatic-initiating cells that can switch cell identity while disseminating to secondary organs. Our data provide a spatially and temporally resolved map of the diversity and trajectories of cancer cell states within the evolving melanoma ecosystem and suggest that the ability to support growth and metastasis are limited to distinct pools of melanoma cells. The observation that these phenotypic competencies can be dynamically acquired upon exposure to specific niche signals warrant the development of therapeutic strategies that interfere with the cancer cell reprogramming activity of such microenvironmental cues.","scRNA-Seq and bulk RNA-Seq","2022-07-06 00:00:00","2022-10-07 00:00:00","Rambow, Florian;Karras, Panagiotis;Pozniak, Joanna","","Karras, Panagiotis et al. “A cellular hierarchy in melanoma uncouples growth and metastasis.” Nature vol. 610,7930 (2022): 190-198. doi:10.1038/s41586-022-05242-7","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE207592","Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens);DNBSEQ-G400 (Mus musculus);Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Mus)","36131018","2"

An unbiased, high through-put gene expression profiling of tissue-resident memory T cells residing in various anatomical location within the lung is fundamental to understand lung immunity but still lacking. In this study, using a well-established model on Klebsiella pneumoniae, we performed an integrative analysis of spatial transcriptome with single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq on lung cells from mice after Immunization using the 10x Genomics Chromium and Visium platform. We employed several deconvolution algorithms and established an optimized deconvolution pipeline to accurately decipher specific cell-type composition by location. We identified and located 12 major cell types by scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic analysis.  Integrating scATAC-seq data from the same cells processed in parallel with scRNA-seq, we found epigenomic profiles provide more robust cell type identification, especially for lineage-specific T helper cells. When combining all three data modalities, we observed a dynamic change in the location of T helper cells as well as their corresponding chemokines for chemotaxis. Furthermore, cell-cell communication analysis of spatial transcriptome provided evidence of lineage-specific T helper cells receiving designated cytokine signaling. In summary, our first-in-class study demonstrated the power of multi-omics analysis to uncover intrinsic spatial- and cell-type-dependent molecular mechanisms of lung immunity.

Kidney resident macrophages (KRMs) are important in homeostasis and the response to acute kidney injury (AKI). While the kidney contains many microenvironments, it is unknown whether KRMs are a heterogeneous population differentiated by function and location. We combined single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), spatial transcriptomics, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence imaging to localize, characterize, and validate KRM populations during quiescence and following 19 minutes of bilateral ischemic kidney injury. scRNAseq and spatial transcriptomics revealed seven distinct KRM subpopulations, which are organized into zones corresponding to regions of the nephron. Each subpopulation was identifiable by a unique transcriptomic signature suggesting distinct functions. Specific protein markers were identified for two clusters allowing analysis by flow cytometry or immunofluorescence imaging. Following injury, the original localization of each subpopulation is lost, either from changing locations or transcriptomic signatures. The original spatial distribution of KRMs is not fully restored for at least 28 days post-injury.

In the invasive niche, tumor cells harbor a collective migration phenotype, supported by the expression of cell-cell junction complexes. In physical proximity, we identify cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with extracellular matrix-remodeling features, as required to support collective migration. Moreover, while tumor cells specifically express Activin A, we find Activin A-induced gene signature enrichment in adjacent CAFs subpopulations, further supporting their biological crosstalk. Altogether, our data identify the subpopulations and their transcriptional reprogramming contributing to the spatial organization of the BCC invasive niche.

During embryonic and postnatal development, microglia exist in multiple transcriptional states. However, it is still poorly understood how these states are established, and whether they are influenced by their cellular environment. Here we show that in the juvenile neocortex, microglia exist in multiple states whose identity and laminar distribution is instructed by the neuronal class identity of local pyramidal neurons. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we unveil molecular signatures of distinct microglia sub-states, and show that they can be divided into layer-restricted or broadly-distributed states. Strikingly, conversion of deep-layer pyramidal neurons to an alternate class identity reconfigures both the density and molecular state of local layer-restricted microglia to correspond to the new neuronal niche, thus identifying specific populations of microglia that are sensitive to pyramidal neuron subtypes. Ligand-receptor interactomes for individual neuronal subtype-microglia pairings uncovers two categories of neuron-to-microglia communication: one associated with neuronal class identity and one associated with microglial state.

This set of observations and the subsequently proposed limits to safe stimulation, termed the “Shannon limits,” allow for a simple calculation (using charge per phase and charge density) to determine the intensity of electrical stimulation that can be delivered safely to brain tissue. In the three decades since the Shannon limits were reported, advances in molecular biology have allowed for more nuanced and detailed approaches to be used to expand current understanding of the physiological effects of stimulation. Here, we investigated spatial transcriptomics as a new approach to assess the safety and efficacy of electrical stimulation in the brain. Electrical stimulation was delivered to the rat visual cortex with either acute or chronic electrode implantation procedures (acute: tissue collection 3 hours post-stimulation on the day of surgery; chronic: stimulation delivered 1-month post-implantation, and tissue collection 24 hours later). To explore the influence of device type and stimulation parameters, we used carbon fiber ultramicroelectrode arrays (7 µm diameter) and microwire electrode arrays (50 µm diameter) delivering charge and charge density levels selected above and below reported tissue damage thresholds (range: 2-20 nC, 0.1-1 mC/cm2). Spatial transcriptomics was performed using Visium Spatial Gene Expression Slides (10x Genomics), which enabled simultaneous immunohistochemistry and spatial transcriptomics to directly compare traditional histological metrics to transcriptional profiles within each tissue sample. Our data revealed unique spatial patterns of differentially expressed genes that are related to cellular processes including inflammation, cell cycle progression, and plasticity. Effects were dependent on stimulation parameters and were localized to both traditional and ultra-small device locations. The abundance of data gathered using this approach allows for sophisticated analysis that can be used to generate new hypotheses while also revealing novel potential biomarkers of neurostimulation.","10 micron tissue section from Long-evans rat visual cortex ~600 microns deep","2022-05-06 00:00:00","2022-07-01 00:00:00","Whitsitt, Quentin;Koo, Beomseo;Celik, Mahmut E;Evans, Blake;Purcell, Erin K;Weiland, James D","","Whitsitt, Quentin A et al. “Spatial Transcriptomics as a Novel Approach to Redefine Electrical Stimulation Safety.” Frontiers in neuroscience vol. 16 937923. 19 Jul. 2022, doi:10.3389/fnins.2022.937923","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE202425","Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Rattus norvegicus)","35928007","1"

We uncovered expression programs across malignant cells and fibroblasts, including a newly-identified neural-like progenitor malignant cell program that was enriched after chemotherapy and radiotherapy and associated with poor prognosis in independent cohorts. Integrating spatial and cellular profiles revealed three multicellular communities: classical, squamoid-basaloid, and treatment-enriched. Our refined molecular and cellular taxonomy can advance precision oncology in PAC through stratification in clinical trials and as roadmap for therapeutic targeting of specific cellular phenotypes and multicellular interactions.","14 specimens received no treatment prior to resection; 7 specimens received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, losartan, and/or nivolumab prior to resection","2022-03-21 00:00:00","2022-05-13 00:00:00","Hwang, William L;Jagadeesh, Karthik A;Guo, Jimmy A;Hoffman, Hannah I;Su, Jennifer;Shiau, Carina;Jacks, Tyler;Regev, Aviv","","Whitsitt, Quentin A et al. “Spatial Transcriptomics as a Novel Approach to Redefine Electrical Stimulation Safety.” Frontiers in neuroscience vol. 16 937923. 19 Jul. 2022, doi:10.3389/fnins.2022.937923","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE199102","Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)","35928007","2"

B cells were enriched in TLS, and therein, we could identify all B cell maturation stages toward plasma cell (PC) formation. B cell repertoire analysis revealed clonal diversification, selection, expansion in TLS, and the presence of fully mature clonotypes at distance. In TLS+ tumors, IgG- and IgA-producing PCs disseminated into the tumor beds along fibroblastic tracks. TLS+ tumors exhibited high frequencies of IgG-producing PCs and IgG-stained and apoptotic malignant cells, suggestive of anti-tumor effector activity. Therapeutic responses and progression-free survival correlated with IgG-stained tumor cells in RCC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, intratumoral TLS sustains B cell maturation and antibody production that is associated with response to immunotherapy, potentially via direct anti-tumor effects.","Spatial transcriptomics of fresh frozen ccRCC human tumors

While CRISPR screens are helping uncover genes regulating many cell-intrinsic processes, existing approaches are suboptimal for identifying gene functions operating extracellularly or within a tissue context. To address this, we developed an approach for spatial functional genomics called Perturb-map, which utilizes protein barcodes (Pro-Code) to enable spatial detection of barcoded cells within tissue. We applied Perturb-map to knockout dozens of genes in parallel in a mouse model of lung cancer and simultaneously assessed how each knockout influenced tumor growth, histopathology, and immune composition. Additionally, we paired Perturb-map and spatial transcriptomics for unbiased molecular analysis of Pro-Code/CRISPR lesions. Our studies found in Tgfbr2 knockout lesions, the TME was converted to a fibro-mucinous state and T-cells excluded, concomitant with upregulated TGFb and TGFb-mediated stroma activation, suggesting Tgfbr2 loss on lung cancer cells increased TGFb bioavailability and enhanced its suppressive effects on the TME.

We further applied these technologies to study the innate response to reovirus infection in the intestine. In addition, we performed time-dependent single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of cardiac tissues of mice infected with a reovirus point mutant that does not cause myocarditis. To establish viral tropism, we implemented molecular enrichment of non-polyadenylated viral transcripts that were otherwise poorly represented in the transcriptomes. Our measurements give insight into the cardiac cell-type specificity of innate immune responses, into the tropism of the virus in the intestine and the heart, and into the transcriptional states of cell types involved in the production of inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of circulating immune cells. Analyses of spatially restricted gene expression in myocarditic regions and the border zone around those regions identified injury and stress responses in different cell types, including cardiomyocytes.

How this works, or whether all dietary FAs are prometastatic, is not known. Here we show that dietary palmitic acid (PA), but not oleic acid (OA) or linoleic acid, promotes metastasis in oral carcinomas and melanoma, indicating specificity of action for distinct FAs. Strikingly, tumours acutely exposed to a PA–rich diet remain highly metastatic even when serially transplanted. This PA–induced prometastatic memory requires the FA transporter CD36 as well as the epigenetically stable deposition of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation by the methyltransferase Set1A/COMPASS. Bulk, single cell and positional RNA sequencing indicate that genes with this metastatic memory predominantly relate to a neural  signature that stimulates activation of intratumor Schwann cells and perineural invasion, two parameters strongly correlated with metastasis but etiologically poorly understood 3-4 . Mechanistically, tumour-associated Schwann cells secrete a specialized pro-regenerative extracellular matrix reminiscent of perineuronal nets, which when ablated strongly inhibits metastatic colonization. The induction of the epigenetic neural signature and its associated long-term boost in metastasis downstream of PA require the transcription factor EGR2 and the glial cell-stimulating peptide galanin. We provide evidence for a long-term epigenetic stimulation of metastasis by a dietary metabolite related to a pro-regenerative state of tumour-activated Schwann cells. In addition to underscoring the potential danger of eating large amounts of PA, our results reveal novel epigenetic and neural-related therapeutic strategies for metastasis.","Single-cell RNA sequencing and Visium Spatial Transcriptomics was used to explore changes in the tumor microenvironment in response to a fatty acid rich diet.

To validate cell2location in real tissue, we applied the model to data from the mouse brain, which features diverse neural cell types organised in a well characterised spatial architecture across brain areas, thus presenting a canonical use case to test spatial genomics. We generated matched single nucleus (sn, this submission) and Visium spatial RNA-seq (10X Genomics) profiles of adjacent mouse brain sections that contain multiple regions from the telencephalon and diencephalon. To assess the biological and intra-organ technical variation in spatial mapping, we assayed two mouse brains and serial tissue sections from each brain (total of 3 and 2 matched sections from two animals, respectively, and an extra section for snRNA-seq), creating a rich multi-modal and replicated transcriptomic dataset.  Tissue processing. Brains of wild-type adult C57BL/6 mice (postnatal day 56, 1 female and 1 male) were dissected, snap frozen, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek) and stored at -80oC. Brain hemispheres were cryosectioned at -20oC using a cryostat (Leica, CM3050S). To assess tissue quality, RNA was extracted from test tissue sections using the RNeasy Pico Kit (Qiagen) and yielded high RIN values (9.6 and 9.7) on an Agilent Bioanalyser, indicating high RNA quality.  For matched single nuclei and Visium RNA-seq experiments, brain hemispheres were cryosectioned to adjacent thick (200 µm) and thin (10 µm) coronal sections, respectively, and processed the same day. In total, four consecutive sets of thick and thin tissue sections were collected from each brain. Five sets of tissue sections yielded both good quality single nuclei and Visium data (three adjacent sections from mouse 1 and two sections from mouse 2) while one additional section from mouse 2 yielded good single nuclei; these were considered for analysis in this study.

In vitro, axons from peripheral afferent neurons derived from DRGs of wild type mice induce MPC proliferation in a spatially-restricted manner via a soluble factor when co-cultured in microfluidic chambers. Comparative spatial transcriptomic analysis of the cranial sutures in vivo confirmed a positive association between sensory axons and proliferative MPCs.

The adult mammalian heart lacks the ability to regenerate. In contrast, the heart of neonatal mice, within the first week after birth, possesses a unique ability to regenerate lost myocardium following injury, mediated by proliferation of cardiomyocytes. The mechanisms whereby neonatal cardiomyocytes adapt to injury-induced stress conditions and activate regenerative cellular programs remain to be defined. Here, we show that Nrf1, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bound transcription factor, is expressed in regenerating cardiomyocytes. Genetic deletion of Nrf1 prevented cardiomyocytes from activating a transcriptional program required for heart regeneration, revealed by single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq).  Conversely, adeno-associated virial (AAV) overexpression of Nrf1 protected the adult mouse heart from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.  Nrf1 also protected human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) from doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. The protective function of Nrf1 is mediated by a dual stress response mechanism involving activation of the proteasome and redox balance. Our findings reveal a mechanistic interplay between adaptive stress responses and heart regeneration, and highlight the central role of Nrf1 in these processes.","Exmination of transcriptome changes in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes overexpresing Nrf1 or Nrf2 .","2020-12-21 00:00:00","2021-09-27 00:00:00","Miao Cui;Ning Liu;Rhonda Bassel-Duby;Eric N Olson","miaocui713@gmail.com","Cui, Miao et al. “Nrf1 promotes heart regeneration and repair by regulating proteostasis and redox balance.” Nature communications vol. 12,1 5270. 6 Sep. 2021, doi:10.1038/s41467-021-25653-w","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE163629","GPL19057","34489413","3"

While single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has helped define these TME cell types, it provides limited information on the mechanisms that define how individual tumor cells interact with TME. Here, we integrate spatial transcriptomics with scRNA-seq to define the architecture and nature of nascent tumor and surrounding microenvironment cells as they come into contact through the process of invasion. Using a well-defined transgenic zebrafish model of BRAFV600E-driven melanoma, we identify a transcriptionally unique â€œinterfaceâ€ cluster localized at the boundary between tumor cells and surrounding tissues. Using an unbiased, data-driven approach, we identify spatially-patterned gene modules specific to the interface and show that the interface is a distinct transcriptional entity that histologically resembles the microenvironment but transcriptionally resembles the tumor. By complementing ST with scRNA-seq, we demonstrate that the interface is composed of specialized tumor and microenvironment cells. Both cell types in the interface upregulate a common set of cilia genes, and we find enrichment of cilia proteins only where the tumor meets the TME. Cilia gene expression is regulated by ETS-family transcription factors, which normally act to suppress their expression outside of this region. This unique ETS-driven interface transcriptional state is conserved across ten different human patient samples, suggesting this is a conserved feature of human melanoma.

Meanwhile, we identified spatial modules and co-varying genes for specific tissue organizations. By performing the integrated analysis of the Stereo-seq and scRNA-seq data from each time point, we reconstructed the spatially resolved developmental trajectories of cell fate transitions and molecular changes during zebrafish embryogenesis.

However, stratification of patients that would benefit most from these modalities remains a major clinical challenge. Here, we combine single nuclei RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics and single cell resolution spatial proteomic analysis of human bladder cancer to identify a novel epithelial subpopulation with therapeutic response prediction ability. These cells were defined by expression of Cadherin 12 (CDH12, N-Cadherin 2), catenins and other epithelial markers. CDH12-enriched tumors define patients with poor outcome following surgery with or without NAC. In contrast, CDH12-enriched tumors had a superior response to ICT. In all settings, patient stratification by tumor CDH12 enrichment offered better prediction of outcome than currently established bladder cancer subtypes. Molecularly, the CDH12 population resembles an undifferentiated state with inherent chemoresistance mediated through ALDH1A1 expression and fibroblast activation potential. Furthermore, CDH12-enriched cells express PD-L1 and PD-L2 and co-localize with exhausted T-cells, possibly mediated through CD49a (ITGA1), providing one explanation for ICT efficacy in these tumors. Altogether, this study describes a new cancer cell population with an intriguing diametric response to the major therapeutic modalities in bladder cancer. Importantly, it also provides a compelling rationale for the design of novel biomarker guided therapeutic clinical trials.","Visium spatial transcriptomics of human treatment-na茂ve muscle-invasive bladder cancer (n=4) fresh-frozen tissue.","2021-04-01 00:00:00","2021-08-24 00:00:00","Kenneth H Gouin III;Nathan Ing;Simon R Knott;Dan Theodorescu","Kgouiniii@gmail.com","Gouin, Kenneth H 3rd et al. “An N-Cadherin 2 expressing epithelial cell subpopulation predicts response to surgery, chemotherapy and immunotherapy in bladder cancer.” Nature communications vol. 12,1 4906. 12 Aug. 2021, doi:10.1038/s41467-021-25103-7","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE171351;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE169379","Illumina NovaSeq 6000","34385456","5"

Here, we characterized four distinct transcript types (lncRNAs, TUCPs, miRNAs and circRNAs) in 31 adult pig tissues and two cell lines, together with protein-coding genes. We dissected their distinct structural and transcriptional features and uncovered transcriptome variability as related to tissue physiology. We discovered extraordinary diversity among 47 anatomically distinct skeletal muscle types, as well as among six adipose depots, which are linked to their diverse origins, metabolic features, cell composition, physical activity and mitochondrial pathways. In particular, transcription of HOX genes across skeletal muscles exhibited a position-dominant pattern, revealing a similar developmental history of these tissues within the same body part. Transcriptional patterns across adipose depots demonstrated a metabolically protective role of subcutaneous adipose tissue and the association of visceral adipose tissue with metabolic dysfunction. Comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of seven tissues of the pig and nine other vertebrates revealed insights into evolutionary divergence of transcription that contributes to lineage-specific tissue biology. We also analyzed long-range regulation of promoters by their enhancers with downstream transcription in subcutaneous adipose tissues of six mammals, showing that evolutionary stability of transcription can mainly be attributed to multiple enhancers buffering gene expression patterns against genetic perturbations, thereby conferring robustness during speciation. Collectively, this study offers a resource for the accelerated use of the pig as a biomedical model for human biology and disease and uncovers molecular bases of its diverse economic traits."," This study takes pig psoas major muscle tissue in two replicates as the object.

However, the spatial distribution of acute kidney injury (AKI) is regional and affects cells heterogeneously. We first optimized coordination of spatial transcriptomics and single nuclear sequencing datasets, mapping 30 dominant cell types to a human nephrectomy. The predicted cell type spots corresponded with the underlying histopathology. To study the implications of AKI on transcript expression, we then characterized the spatial transcriptomic signature of two murine AKI models: ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and cecal ligation puncture (CLP). Localized regions of reduced overall expression were associated with injury pathways. Using single cell sequencing, we deconvoluted the signature of each spatial transcriptomic spot, identifying patterns of colocalization between immune and epithelial cells. Neutrophils infiltrated the renal medulla in the ischemia model. Atf3 was identified as a chemotactic factor in S3 proximal tubules. In the CLP model, infiltrating macrophages dominated the outer cortical signature and Mdk was identified as a corresponding chemotactic factor. The regional distribution of these immune cells was validated with multiplexed CO-Detection by inDEXing (CODEX) immunofluorescence. Spatial transcriptomic sequencing complements single cell sequencing by uncovering mechanisms driving immune cell infiltration and detection of relevant cell subpopulations.","A single human reference nephrectomy (female aged 59 without histologic evidence of kidney disease) was acquired from the Biopsy Biobank Cohort of Indiana (BBCI).

In the IRI model both renal pedicles were exposed and clamped for 22 minutes through a midline incision then released. In the CLP model, the cecum was ligated and punctured with a 25 gauge needle.

While myocardial degeneration and fibro-fatty replacement occurs in specific locations, the underlying molecular changes remain poorly characterized. Here we aim to delineate local changes in gene expression to help identify new genes or pathways that are relevant for specific remodelling processes occurring during ACM. | Methods and Results | Using Tomo-Seq, a genome-wide transcriptional profiling with high spatial resolution, we created a transmural epicardial to endocardial gene expression atlas of an explanted ACM heart to gain molecular insights into disease-driving processes. This enabled us to link gene expression profiles to the different regional remodelling responses and allowed us to identify genes that are potentially relevant for disease progression. In doing we revealed BTB (broad-complex, tramtrack, bric-Ã -brac) domain containing 11 (ZBTB11) to be specifically enriched at sites of active fibrofatty replacement of myocardium. Immunohistochemistry indicated ZBTB11 to be enriched in cardiomyocytes flanking fibrofatty areas, which could be confirmed in multiple cardiomyopathy patients. Forced overexpression of ZBTB11 in iPS-derived cardiomyocytes showed ZBTB11 to function as a potent inducer of cardiomyocyte atrophy. | Conclusion | By combining spatial transcriptomics with classical histological approaches we identified gene expression changes underlying local remodelling responses in ACM. In doing so we found ZBTB11 to function as a relevant driver of cardiomyocyte atrophy. These data show the power of Tomo-Seq to unveil new molecular mechanisms and indicate ZBTB11 as a potential new target for cardiomyopathy. ","The dataset contains the following experiments: 1. Spatial transcriptomics by RNA-tomography (TomoSeq) on 20um sections on diseased heart. After isolation, we cryosectioned samples, extracted RNA from the individual sections, and amplified and barcoded mRNA using the CEL-seq protocol as in (Junker 2014, PMID: 25417113). Libraries were sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 using 75p paired end sequencing. 2. Bulk RNA-seq processed by the CEL-seq protocol. IPS derived cardiomyocytes were transduced with AAV-ZBTB11, AAV-GFP, or not transduced. 7 days after transduction, cells were harvested and RNA-Seq was performed.

Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function, by enabling a transcriptome wide evaluation of gene expression in-situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to regions (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell-aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyzes are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum ofÂ  cell states, which can not be clearly demarcated and may reflect important differences in the cellsâ€™ function and interaction with their surrounding. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi- resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics, which explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods, and that it is also the first method to enable an estimate of gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline for analysis of a tissue, as well as comparison between tissues. We apply DestVI and this pipeline to study the response of lymph nodes to a pathogen and to explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a reliable view of the organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).","Lymph nodes from mice treated with mycobacterium or PBS or MCA205 tumor were used.

Here we present the first single-cell investigation of differential isoform expression (DIE) between brain regions, by performing single cell long-read transcriptome sequencing in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in 45 cell types at postnatal day 7. Using isoform tests for brain-region specific DIE, which outperform exon-based tests, we detect hundreds of brain-region specific DIE events traceable to specific cell-types. Many DIE events correspond to functionally distinct protein isoforms, some with just a 6-nucleotide exon variant. In most instances, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. Cell types indigenous to only one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, where for example, the choroid plexus epithelium manifest unique transcription start sites. However, for some genes, multiple cell-types are responsible for DIE in bulk data, indicating that regional identity can, although less frequently, override cell-type specificity. We validated our findings with spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing, yielding the first spatially resolved splicing map in the postnatal mouse brain (www.isoformAtlas.com).

Staging patients along the sepsis timeline requires a thorough knowledge of the evolution of cellular and molecular events at the tissue level. Here, we investigated the kidney, an organ central to the pathophysiology of sepsis. Single cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics revealed the involvement of various cell populations in injury and repair to be temporally organized and highly orchestrated. We identified key changes in gene expression that altered cellular functions and can explain features of clinical sepsis. These changes converged towards a remarkable global cell-cell communication failure and organ shutdown at a well-defined point in the sepsis timeline. Importantly, this time point was also a transition towards the emergence of recovery pathways. This rigorous spatial and temporal definition of murine sepsis will uncover precise biomarkers and targets that can help stage and treat human sepsis.","The 129sv mouse was sacrificed 6 hours after cecal ligation puncture and tissue was placed in an OCT mold and stored at -80 C. A septic mouse kidney was immediately frozen in Optimal Cutting Temperature media (O.C.T.).

Images of hematoxylin-eosin-labeled tissues were collected as mosaics of 10x fields using a Keyence BZ-X810 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon 10x CFI Plan Fluor objective. The tissue was then permeabilized for 12 minutes and RNA was isolated. The cDNA libraries were prepared and then sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Using Seurat 3.1.4, we identified anchors between the integrated single cell object and the spatial transcriptomics datasets and used those to transfer the cluster data from the single cell to the spatial transcriptomics.

We combine a microarray-based spatial transcriptomics method that reveals spatial patterns of gene expression using an array of spots, each capturing the transcriptomes of multiple adjacent cells, with scRNA-Seq generated from the same sample. To annotate the precise cellular composition of distinct tissue regions, we introduce a method for multimodal intersection analysis. Applying multimodal intersection analysis to primary pancreatic tumors, we find that subpopulations of ductal cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and cancer cells have spatially restricted enrichments, as well as distinct coenrichments with other cell types. Furthermore, we identify colocalization of inflammatory fibroblasts and cancer cells expressing a stress-response gene module.

Here we employed single-cell RNA-sequencing to extensively characterise the cellular landscape of human liver, from development to disease. We analysed ~212,000 cells representing human fetal liver, HCC and mouse liver. Our analysis revealed a remarkable fetal-like reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Specifically, the HCC ecosystem displayed features reminiscent of fetal development, including the re-emergence of fetal-associated endothelial cells (PLVAP+/VEGFR2+), and fetal-like (FOLR2+) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). In a cross-species comparative analysis, we discovered remarkable similarity of gene expression and regulatory networks between mouse embryonically-seeded, fetal-liver and FOLR2+ tumor macrophages. Spatial transcriptomics further corroborated a shared onco-fetal ecosystem between fetal-liver and HCC. Furthermore, gene regulatory analysis, spatial transcriptomics, and in vitro functional assays implicated VEGF and NOTCH signaling in maintaining onco-fetal ecosystem. Taken together, we report a shared immunosuppressive onco-fetal ecosystem between the human fetal-liver and HCC. Our results unravel a previously unexplored onco-fetal reprogramming of tumor ecosystem, provides a novel target for therapeutic interventions in HCC and also opens up avenues for identifying similar paradigms in other cancers and disease states.","Analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and human fetal liver samples ,Tissue slides from 3 HCC patients (adjacent normal & tumor section for each) and 3 human fetal liver samples were used for this experiment. 12 regions of interests were selected for each of the 9 samples so a total of 108 regions of interests were analysed.

The 3D transcriptome reveals that (i) the epiblast is partitioned into transcription domains corresponding to regions of epiblast where cells are endowed specifically with ectoderm and mesendoderm potency, (ii) novel lineage markers are identified as genes expressed in epiblast domains populated by cells displaying different lineage fates, (iii) functionally related gene regulatory circuitry and signaling pathways are acting in concert in the transcriptional domains, and (iv) the spatial information provides reference zipcodes for mapping the prospective address of cell samples from different embryos and stem cell lines. The quantified expression data can also be visualized as “3D digitized whole mount in situ hybridization” of all the expressed transcripts in the epiblast."," (i) By using lasermicrodissection, we carried out transcriptome profiling on embryo sections at a high resolution of ~20 cells per sample with the spatial information preserved. We then constructed a comprehensive spatial transcriptome map in the midgastrulation embryo that is visualized in a 3D embryonic model based on the sequencing data.

Concurrent with the transition of the pluripotency states is the specification of cell lineages and formation of germ layers in the embryos that serves as the blueprint for embryogenesis. Fate mapping and lineage analysis studies have revealed that cells in different regions of the germ layers acquire location-specific cell fates during gastrulation. The regionalization of cell fates heralding the formation of the basic body plan is conserved in vertebrate embryos at a common phylotypic stage of development. Knowledge of the molecular regulation that underpin the lineage specification and tissue patterning is instrumental for understanding embryonic programming and stem cell-based translational study. However, a genome-wide molecular annotation of lineage segregation and tissue architecture of post-implantation embryo has yet to be undertaken. Here, we reported a spatially resolved transcriptome of cell populations at defined positions in the germ layers over the period of pre- to late gastrulation development. This spatio-temporal transcriptome provides high resolution digitized gene expression profiles and defines the molecular attribute of the genealogy of lineages and continuum of pluripotency states in time and space. The transcriptome further identifies the networks of molecular determinants that drive lineage specification and tissue patterning in the early postimplantation mouse embryo.","By using spatial transcriptome of Geo-seq, we carried out transcriptome profiling on embryo sections at a high resolution of 20-40 cells per sample.

Although stress granules dramatically alter mRNA and protein localization, understanding these complexes has proven to be challenging through conventional imaging, purification, and crosslinking approaches. We therefore developed an RNA proximity labeling technique, APEX-Seq, which uses the ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 to probe the spatial organization of the transcriptome. We show that APEX-Seq can resolve the localization of RNAs within the cell and determine their enrichment or depletion near key RNA-binding proteins. Matching both the spatial transcriptome using APEX-seq, and the spatial proteome using APEX-mass spectrometry (APEX-MS) provide new insights into the organization of translation initiation complexes on active mRNAs, as well as revealing unanticipated complexity in stress granule contents, and provides a powerful approach to explore the spatial environment of macromolecules.","APEX-eIF4E, APEX-eIF4A, APEX-GFP, C1-APEX, and APEX-CBX1 under Naive conditions were used to assess within and between compartment differnces were performed in duplicate with their corresponding input samples using a Hiseq4000.

From age-matched 8-10 week old 129/ SvEv mice (Taconic Biosciences, Albany, New York), tissues were acquired from a sham mouse in which the abdomen was opened and sutured back and mice which underwent ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In the IRI model both renal pedicles were exposed and clamped for 22 minutes through a midline incision then released. In the CLP model, the cecum was ligated and punctured with a 25 gauge needle. Kidneys were excised upon sacrifice 6 hours after each procedure and frozen in Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound.

Single-cell RNA-Seq captures molecular profiles but not spatial organization. Conversely, spatial profiling assays to date have lacked global transcriptome information, throughput or single-cell resolution. Here, we develop High-Density Spatial Transcriptomics (HDST), a method for RNA-Seq at high spatial resolution. Spatially barcoded reverse transcription oligonucleotides are coupled to beads that are randomly deposited into tightly packed individual microsized wells on a slide. The position of each bead is decoded with sequential hybridization using complementary oligonucleotides providing a unique bead-specific spatial address. We then capture, and spatially in situ barcode, RNA from the histological tissue sections placed on the HDST array. HDST recovers hundreds of thousands of transcript-coupled spatial barcodes per experiment at 2 μm resolution. We demonstrate HDST in the mouse brain, use it to resolve spatial expression patterns and cell types, and show how to combine it with histological stains to relate expression patterns to tissue architecture and anatomy. HDST opens the way to spatial analysis of tissues at high resolution.","Three sections of the main olfactory bulb from adult C57BL/6J mice","2019-05-03 00:00:00","2019-09-20 00:00:00","Sanja Vickovic;Ludvig Bergenstråhle","vickovic@broadinstitute.org","Vickovic, Sanja et al. “High-definition spatial transcriptomics for in situ tissue profiling.” Nature methods vol. 16,10 (2019): 987-990. doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0548-y","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE130682","Illumina NextSeq 500","31501547","5"

APEX-seq in nine distinct subcellular locales produced a nanometer-resolution spatial map of the human transcriptome as a resource, revealing extensive patterns of localization for diverse RNA classes and transcript isoforms. We uncover a radial organization of the nuclear transcriptome, which is gated at the inner surface of the nuclear pore for cytoplasmic export of processed transcripts. We identify two distinct pathways of messenger RNA localization to mitochondria, each associated with specific sets of transcripts for building complementary macromolecular machines within the organelle. APEX-seq should be widely applicable to many systems, enabling comprehensive investigations of the spatial transcriptome.","APEX-seq libraries for both labeled targets and unlabeled controls were generated for the following constructs: (1) NLS (nucleus), (2) NIK (nucleolus), (3) LMA (nuclear lamina), (4) NucPore (nuclear pore), (5) NES (cytosol), (6) ERM (ER membrane cytosol facing), (7) KDEL (ER lumen), (8) OMM (Outer mitochondrial membrane), and (9) MITO (mitochondrial matrix). 4 libraries were prepared for each construct (2 biological replicates for labeled targets, 2 biological replicates for unlabeled controls). Furthermore, we generated drug-perturbation libraries for OMM and NES using the following treatments: (1) cycloheximide, (2) puromycin and (3) m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). In addition, nocodazole-perturbation libraries for OMM and NES were generated following drug treatment for: (1) 3 minutes, (2) 6 minutes, (3) 9 minutes, (4) 30 minutes and (5) 2 hours. We also generated nuclear and cytosol fractionation RNA-seq libraries (2 replicates each) following a protocol by Gagnon et al.

Here, we have used spatial | transcriptomics to generate high-resolution, anteroposterior gene expression maps of C. elegans males and hermaphrodites. To explore these maps, we have developed computational methods for discovering region- and tissue-specific genes.  | We have found extensive sex-specific gene expression differences in the germline and sperm and discovered genes that are specifically expressed in the male reproductive tract. These include a group of uncharacterized genes that encode small secreted proteins that are required for male fertility. We conclude that spatial gene expression maps provide a powerful resource for identifying tissue-specific gene functions in C. elegans. Importantly, we found that expression maps from different animals can be precisely aligned, enabling transcriptome-wide comparisons of gene expression patterns.","Spatial transcriptomics by RNA-tomography (TomoSeq) on 20um sections","2018-05-21 00:00:00","2018-11-05 00:00:00","Annabel Ebbing;Abel Vertesy;Marco Betist;Bastiaan Spanjaard;Jan P Junker;Eugene Berezikov;Alexander van Oudenaarden;Hendrik C Korswagen","","Ebbing, Annabel et al. “Spatial Transcriptomics of C. elegans Males and Hermaphrodites Identifies Sex-Specific Differences in Gene Expression Patterns.” Developmental cell vol. 47,6 (2018): 801-813.e6. doi:10.1016/j.devcel.2018.10.016","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE114723","GPL13657","30416013","2"

However, the cellular architecture of hypothalamic nuclei, including the molecular identity, spatial organization, and function of distinct cell types, is poorly understood. Here, we developed an imaging-based cell type identification and mapping method and combined it with single-cell RNA-sequencing to create a molecularly annotated and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. We profiled ~1 million cells, identified ~70 neuronal populations characterized by distinct neuromodulatory signatures and spatial organizations, and defined specific neuronal populations activated during key social behaviors in male and female mice, providing a high-resolution framework for mechanistic investigation of behavior circuits. The approach described here opens a new avenue for the construction of cell atlases in diverse tissues and organisms.","","2018-11-03 00:00:00","2018-11-03 00:00:00","Zhuang X;Dulac C","zhuang@chemistry.harvard.edu","Moffitt, Jeffrey R et al. “Molecular, spatial, and functional single-cell profiling of the hypothalamic preoptic region.” Science (New York, N.Y.) vol. 362,6416 (2018): eaau5324. doi:10.1126/science.aau5324","https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8t8s248;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE113576","","30385464","5"
